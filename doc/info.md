GOAL: 
Create a RAG implementation with:
Support for PDF/markdown/text files
Vector embedding generation
Vector database setup (Pinecone)
Query processing
Convert user query to embedding
Semantic search against document vector DB
Chunk retrieval (top-k similarity)

Response generation with context
Use Gemini API to generate answers from retrieved chunks
Include source citations

Use Langchain for orchestration. The package manager we will be using is uv. I have already created a virtual environment in which we can install packages using uv.
